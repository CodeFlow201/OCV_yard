# OCV_yard

## AIM : To explore Open CV library and apply in different projects

#### In this we would be exploring different-different applications that we could do with the use of Open CV library, starting from very basic to advance, project aim to accomplish most of the use cases.

## How to contribute?
 - Are you having an new application or usecase with the use of open CV
    - Just move ahead to issue tab and open a issue with brief introduction of your idea
    - once issue assigned to you, open a pull request
    - After positive review, :hugs: congratulations your pull request is merged  
    
- Dont have idea but want to contribute  
    - Head over to issues page
    -choose the best suited issue
    -start by asking doubts and working over the issue
    - make pull request and have the review
    -finally 	:hugs: pull request merge  


To start contributing, follow the below guidelines: 

**1.**  Fork [this](git@github.com:Contributed-Repositories/OCV_yard.git) repository.

**2.**  Clone your forked copy of the project.

     $ git clone https://github.com/<your_user_name>/OCV_yard.git

     
**3.** Checkout into a new branch 

     $ git checkout -b <branch_name>

**4.** Make your changes

**5.** Add and commit your changes

     $ git add . && git commit -m "<your_message>"
     
**6.** Push Code to Github under your branch 

     $ git push origin <branch_name>   


## Scope 

- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.
- OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.

> Transportation - with autonomous driving in ADAS (automated driver assist system) in traffic signs detection, pedestrian detection, safety features such driver fatigue detection etc.

> Medical imaging - mammography, cardiovascular and microscopic image analysis (Iâ€™m not a medicine guy but I am hearing that a whole lot of computer imaging aided decision-making such as automated detection and counting of microorganisms will involve use of opencv).

> Manufacturing - Ton of computer vision stuff there as well such as rotation invariant detection on a conveyer belt with dtection of stoke of robotic gripping.

> Public order and security - pedestrain/citizen detection and tracking, mob management, prediction of future events.
